            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This word, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> is the beginning of this book, which we finde firſt placed of all the holy books; And alſo of the Goſpel by Saint <hi>John,</hi> which we know to be laſt written of all.

And <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>In the Beginning,</hi> hath ever been uſed powerfully, and proſperouſly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Philoſophers and Hereticks relapſed into an opinion of the worlds eternity.

It is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169845:21"/>not then all <hi>one</hi> Beginning; for here God <hi>Did,</hi> there he <hi>Was.</hi> That confeſſes a <hi>limitation of time,</hi> this excludes it.<note place="margin">Caninius Conc.

                     <hi>I am firſt and laſt, which is, and was, and is to come.</hi> And hereby they would eſtabliſh his coeternity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantialneſs, becauſe he can be no creature, who is preſent at the firſt Creation. But becauſe although to us, whom the Spirit hath made faithfully credulous, and filled us with an aſſurance of this truth, every conducing, and convenient application governs and commands our aſſent, becauſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169845:22"/>it doth but remember us, not teach us. But to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who roundly deny this Expoſition, &amp; to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who accept it, and yet call Chriſt a creature, as fore-created for an Aſſiſtant in this ſecond Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; theſe detortions have ſmall force, but as Sun-beams ſtriking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, or arrows diverted with a twig by the way, they leſſen their ſtrength, being turned upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mark then they were deſtined to. And therefore by the Example of our late learned Reformers, I forbear this interpretation; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe we are utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of any hiſtory of the Worlds Creation, except we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain this Book of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be Hiſtorical, and therefore literally to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.

                     </note> becauſe it is halfe true; But that the later part is true, or that God purpoſed to reveal it in his Book, it ſeems doubtfull, becauſe <hi>Sextus Senenſis</hi> reckons almoſt thirty ſeverall ſupputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the years between the Creation, and our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours birth, all of accepted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, grounded upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and <hi>Pererius</hi> confeſſes, he might have encreaſed the number by 20.

Yet not equally; for the break of the day, becauſe it hath a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of more and more light, is clearer then the ſhutting in, which is overtaken with more and more darkneſſe; ſo is the birth of the world more diſcernable then the death, becauſe upon this God hath caſt more clouds: yet ſince the world in her firſt infancy did not ſpeak to us at all (by any Authors;) and when ſhe began to ſpeak by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhe ſpake not plain, but diverſly to divers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; we muſt return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to our ſtrong hold, <hi>faith,</hi> and end with this, <hi>That this Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, and before it, Nothing.</hi> It is elder then darkneſſe, which is elder then light; And was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Confuſion, which is elder

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169845:25"/>the receiver, and beholder: Our ſelves have his Image, as Medals, permanently and preciouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But by theſe meditations we get no further, then to know what he <hi>doth,</hi> not what he <hi>is.</hi> But as by the uſe of the Compaſs, men ſafely diſpatch <hi>

And though the faithfulleſt heart is not ever directly, &amp; conſtantly upon God, but that it ſomtimes deſcends alſo to Reaſon; yet it is thereby ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, but that it ſtill looks towards him, though not fully to him: as the Compaſs is ever Northward, though it decline, and have often variations towards Eaſt, and Weſt. By this faith, as by reaſon, I know, that God is all that which all men can ſay

And too particular and reſtrain'd are all thoſe deſcents of God in his word, when he ſpeaks of a body, and of paſſions, like ours. And ſuch alſo is their reverend ſilence, who have expreſſed God in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks, ever determining in ſome one power of God, without larger extent. And laſtly, can thy great capacity be fulfilled with that knowledg, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church affords of God? which, as though the ſtate of a Monarchy were too terrible, and refulgent for our ſight, hath changed the

This <hi>Adam</hi> was able to do. And an enormous pretending Wit of our nation and age undertook to frame ſuch a language, herein exceeding <hi>Adam,</hi> that whereas he named every thing by the moſt eminent and virtuall property, our man gave names, by the firſt naked enuntiation whereof, any underſtanding ſhould compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the eſſence of the thing, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then by a definition. And ſuch a name, we who know not Gods eſſence cannot give him. So that it is truly ſaid,<note place="margin">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169845:28"/>therfore ſometimes ſuſpected, that there was ſome degree of pride, and overboldneſs, in the firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of God; the rather, becauſe I marke, that the firſt which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pronounced the name,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note>

                     <p>Of the name uſed in this place,

But as old age is juſtly charged with this ſickneſs, that though it abound, it ever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets, though it need leſs then youth did: ſo hath alſo this decrepit age of the world ſuch a ſickneſs; for though we have now a clearer underſtanding of the Scriptures then former times, (for we inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the talents and travels of al Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors, and have overlived moſt of the prophecies,) and though the groſs thick clouds of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> be diſperſed, and ſo we have few enemies; yet we affect, and ſtrain at more Arguments for the <hi>Trinity,</hi> then thoſe times did, which needed them more.

It ſatisfies me, for the phraſe, that I am taught by collation of many places in the Scriptures, that it is a meer Idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.

And as, though thy ſelf hadſt no beginning thou gaveſt a beginning to all things in which thou wouldſt be ſerved and glorified; ſo, though this ſoul of mine, by which I partake thee, begin not now, yet let this minute, O God, this happy minute of thy viſitation, be the beginning of her converſion, and ſhaking away confuſion, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and barrenneſſe; and let her now produce Creatures, thoughts, words, and deeds agreeable to thee. And let her not produce them, O God, out of any contemplation, or</hi> (<hi>I cannot ſay,</hi> Idaea, <hi>but</hi>) Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>of my worthineſſe, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a man and no worme, and within the pale of thy Church, and not in the wild forreſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with ſome glimerings of Naturall knowledge; but meerely out of Nothing: Nothing prexiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

By which, as thou didſt ſo make Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as thou didſt not neglect Earth, and madeſt them anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and agreeable to one another, ſo let my Soul's Creatures have that temper and Harmony, that they be not by a miſdevout conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the next life, ſtupidly and trecherouſly negligent of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and duties which thou enjoyneſt amongst us in this life; nor ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious in theſe, that the other (which is our better buſineſs, though this alſo muſt be attended) be the leſs endeavoured. Thou haſt, O God, denyed even to Angells, the ability of arriving from one Extreme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, without paſſing the mean way between. Nor can we paſs from the priſon of our Mothers womb, to thy palace, but we muſt walk (in that pace whereto thou haſt enabled us) through the ſtreet of this life, and not ſleep at the firſt corner, nor in the midſt. Yet ſince my ſoul is ſent immediately from thee, (let me for her return) rely,

                     <p>Our next conſideration is, <hi>Why they are diverſly named? and not alwayes alike,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. and here, and in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and the other places where they are ſpoken of?

To change the Name, in the party himſelf is, by many laws, <hi>Dolus;</hi> and when a Notary doth it, he is <hi>falſarius;</hi> faults penall and infamous. And therefore laws have provided, that in inſtruments of contract, and in publick Regiſters, all the Names, Sur-names and additions ſhall be inſerted; and they forbid <hi>Abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations;</hi> and they appoint a more conſpicuous and more permanent Character to expreſs them. So ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169845:57"/>is a certainty and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Names. Some late inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the law,<note place="margin">Acacius de privil.

So, though Error and variety in Names, may be pardonable in profane Hiſtories, eſpecially ſuch as tranſlate from Authors of other language, yet the wiſdome and conſtancy of that one Author of al theſe books, the Holy Ghoſt, is likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and eſtabliſh all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, choſen for building this frame of Scriptures, from any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine

                     <p>The <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> therfore, which are the Anatomiſts of words, and have a Theologicall Alchimy to draw ſoveraigne tinctures and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from plain and groſſe literall matter, obſerve in every variety ſome great myſtick ſignification; but ſo it is almoſt in every He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew name and word. <hi>Lyra,</hi> who is not ſo refined, yet very Judaick too, thinks, that as with the Latin, <hi>Cholaus, Choletus, Cholinus,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> is one Name; ſo it is in the variation of names in the Scriptures. But of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, neither the ſound, nor letter, nor ſignification, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning nor ending, nor roote, nor branch, have any affinity: as himſelfe (though corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſays, that <hi>Eſau; Seir,</hi> and <hi>Edom</hi> are one name.<note place="margin">Gen. 36.</note> It may be ſome lazineſs to anſwer every thing thus, <hi>It is ſo, becauſe God would have it ſo;</hi> yet he which goes further, and asks, Why Gods will was ſo, inquires for

For, ſince he is content to receive his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from us, (for although all cauſe of Honour be eternally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in himſelfe, yet that Act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from us, and of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is <hi>in Honorante,</hi> he could have none, til he had made Creatures to exhibit it;) his great work of Creation, which admits no arreſt for our Reaſon, nor gradations for our diſcourſe, but muſt be at once ſwallowed and devour'd by faith, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication, or digeſtion, is not ſo apt to work upon us, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking of our Acts of Honour,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169845:65"/>as thoſe other miracles are, which are ſomewhat more ſubmitted to reaſon, and exerciſe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our diſputation, and ſpiritual curioſity by the way, and yet at laſt go as far beyond reaſon, as the other; as all miracles do equally. Of that kind this is; becauſe a mighty People is mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly made, not of Nothing, (upon which, Conſideration can take no hold) but of a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall, and incompetent lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe. And in theſe, where the ſmallneſſe of the roote, or ſeed, is a degree of the miracle, the Spirit of God uſes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in recording it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the greateſt of that kind, which is the fulfilling and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the world, after that great exinanition by the generall deluge, though <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay twice or thrice, that <hi>Noah,</hi> and his ſonnes, and his and their wives went into the Ark, and came out; yet, becauſe the Miracle of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating conſiſts in the Number, Almighty God is pleaſed, by his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169845:65"/>ordinary way of expounding his word, (which is, to explicate and aſſure one place by another) to teach us, that this Number was but eight: for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>In the Ark but few,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note>

Nothing therefore ſeems ſo much to indanger the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to ſubmit and render them obnoxious to cenſure and calumniation, as the apparance of Error in Chronology, or other limbs and members of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: for,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Enchirid.</note> ſince Error is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of falſe for true, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain for certain, the Author hath erred (and then the Author is not God) if any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be falſly delivered; And we erre, if we arreſt our ſelves as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And as a man delated jurid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, or by fame, or by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate information of any Crime, muſt, when Canonicall purgation is required at his hands, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweare his own innocency him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but produce others of his neighbourhood and friendſhip, to ſwear that they think he ſwears true; and if they concurr'd not with him, this would have the nature of a half-proof, and juſtifie a further proceeding to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: ſo when any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Hiſtorie riſes up againſt any place of Scripture, accuſing it to Humane Reaſon, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, (for though in our ſupreme Court in ſuch caſes, for the laſt Appeal be Faith, yet Reaſon is her Delegate) it is not enough that one place juſtify it ſelf to ſay true, but all other places produced as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169845:67"/>handling the ſame matter, muſt be of the ſame opinion, and of one harmony. I have therefore wondred that <hi>Althemerus,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to reconcile all apparant diſcordances in the Scriptures, hath utterly pretermitted all vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in Numbring: Of Examples whereof, the comparing of the Hiſtoricall books, would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him great plenty, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his travell. The generall reaſons why God admits ſome ſuch diverſities in his book, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail alſo for this place which is now under our conſideration; which are, firſt, To make men ſharpe and induſtrious in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of truth, he withdrawes it from preſent apprehenſion, and obviouſneſs. For naturally great wits affect the reading of obſcure books, wraſtle and ſweat in the explication of propheſies, digg and threſh out the words of unle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible hands, reſuſcitate and bring to life again the mangled, and lame fragmentary images and characters in Marbles and Medals,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169845:67"/>becauſe they have a joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in the victory and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement thereof. Another reaſon is, That as his elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſubmitted by him to the malice and calumny of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and are not only ragefully tempeſted with ſtormes of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but contemptuouſly and ſcornfully (which is oftentimes the greater affliction) inſimulated of folly and ſillineſs, are in his knowledg, and often ſo declared in this world to abound in the treaſure of riches and wiſdome: So he is pleaſed that his word ſhould endure and undergo the opinion of contradiction, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmiries, in the eyes of Pride (the Author of Hereſie and Schiſm) that after all ſuch diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169845:68"/>to that beſt way of expounding Scriptures, by comparing one place with another. All the doubts about this place determine in two. Firſt, why the Number is in ſo many places ſaid to be <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.27. and in this place of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.22. And yet <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.26. the Number is ſaid to be but 66. And in all the proceſs of time from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s to <hi>Stephen's</hi> martyrdome, recorded <hi>Act.</hi> 7. there could be no other doubt but this one, to them which underſtood Hebrew, and were not miſgoverned by the tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> And this firſt doubt is no ſooner offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then anſwered; for in the 46. of <hi>Gen.</hi> the 26 verſe ſpeaks of 66, and conſiders not <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his two ſons, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which the 27. verſe doth, and adding <hi>Jacob</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, perfects the Number 70. of which it ſpeaks. So that here is no diſſonance in the Number, but only the Spirit of God hath uſed his liberty, in the phraſe, recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169845:68"/>ſome born in <hi>Egypt</hi> among the ſoules which came into <hi>Egypt.</hi> The other Doubt, which hath more travelled the Expoſitors, is, why <hi>Stephen,</hi> referring to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> ſhould ſay, they were 75. The occaſion of this miſtaking (for ſo I think it was) was given by falſe Copies of the <hi>Septuagint's</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in moſt uſe. For the Hebrew text was long before ſo farr out of ordinary uſe, that we ſee our Saviour himſelf, in his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, follows the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> And in my mind, ſo much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is due to that tranſlation, that it were hard to think, that they at firſt added five to <hi>Moſes</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For, that which is ſaid for that opinion (though by Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>) which is, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome nephews of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> hath no warrant; and all the reſt of the brethren were likely to have nephews at that time alſo. And againſt this opinion it prevails much with me, that, by Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> teſtimony, that tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his time, in the other place,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169845:69"/>
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.22. had but 70, conform to <hi>Moſes:</hi> And any reaſon which might have induced them to add 5 in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> had been as ſtrong for <hi>Deuteronomy. Junius,</hi> ſcarce exceeded by any,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 92.</note> in learning, ſharpneſs, and faith, thinks that <hi>Stephen</hi> neither applyed his ſpeech to that account of thoſe that were iſſued from <hi>Jacob</hi>'s loyns, which were indeed but 66, nor to the addition of the three in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which, with <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd the number of 70; but that, inſiſting preciſely upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſyllables, he related ſo many as were expreſſed by name by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in that Chapter, to have been of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family; which were <hi>Jacob</hi>'s four wives, and the two ſons of <hi>Judah,</hi> which make up 75. But with that modeſty wherein he asks leave to depart from the Fathers, I muſt depart from him: for <hi>Joſeph</hi> could not cauſe theſe two ſons of <hi>Judah</hi> to be brought into <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as appears in the Text he did, for all the number there intended,) ſince
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169845:69"/>they were dead in <hi>Canaan</hi> before, as is evident, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 46. Others therefore have thought, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> reported not the words out of <hi>Stephen</hi>'s mouth, but by view of <hi>Moſes</hi> his text, and that but in the Tranſlation; becauſe being but a Proſelite, he had no perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor was accuſtom'd to the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> And others, that indulgently he deſcended to that text which was moſt familiar, and ſo moſt credible to them. For, though this be either an apparant Error in the <hi>Septuagint</hi> at firſt, (which is hard to allow, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve half of that which uſes to be ſaid, in proof; that the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſted them) Or a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption inſinuated after, (as it is eaſie, when Numbers are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by numerant letters,) yet that tranſlation, ſo corrupted, had ſo much weight, that all then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it; and it maintained that authority ſo long, that even in <hi>Lyra's</hi> time the Latin obeyed it. For he reads in this place of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> 75. though he there confeſs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169845:70"/>the Hebrew hath but 70. This in my underſtanding may ſafelyer be admitted, then to decline ſo farr as Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> doth, who thinks it poſſible that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> repos'd the true Number 70; but ſome other exſcriber, ignorant of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and obedient to the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,</hi> reformed it deformly ſince his writing; for this ſeems to me to open dangerouſly a way to the infringing, or infirming ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of Scripture. The Number being then certainly 70, ſince by the hardneſs and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Phraſe, there ſeems ſome violence and force, to raiſe the Number to 75. (for it may ſeem hard, that <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which ſent for theſe 70, ſhould be called one of the 70 which came; And that his two Sons already in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> ſhould be two of them which came into <hi>Egypt;</hi> And that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould be one of theſe 70 which iſſued out of <hi>Jacobs</hi> loins;) in a few words we will conſider,<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Number</hi> 70.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Myſtery reſide in that choſen Number; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169845:70"/>very many remarkable things, and paſſages in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, ſeeme to me to have been limited in that Number, which therefore ſeems more Periodick then any other.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe any over curious and Myſterious conſideration of this Number 70. though it be compoſed of the two greateſt Numbers (for <hi>Ten</hi> cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, but that to expreſs any further Number you muſt take a part of it again; and <hi>Seven</hi> is ever uſed to expreſs infinite,) be too Cabaliſtick and Pythagorick for a vulgar Chriſtian, (which I offer not for a phraſe of Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diſtruſt, that ſuch are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of ſufficient defences for themſelves, or are ignorant of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing required in ſuch as they, for ſalvation; But that there is needed alſo a Meta-theology, and ſuper-divinity, above that which ſerves our particular conſciences, in them, who muſt fight againſt Philoſophers and Jews) becauſe I am one, and in a low degree, of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169845:71"/>the firſt and vulgar rank, and write but to my equals, I will forbear it, as miſ-interpretable; ſince to ſome-palates it may taſte of Oſtentation; but to ſome, of diſtraction from better contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, and of ſuperſtition to others: yet, we may, as well with reverence to the things, as reſpect to the Number, reſt a little upon thoſe works of God, or his Servants, which this Number, at leaſt, reduces to our memory.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169845:74"/>that all are mingled equally, yet in every one of them, every one of theſe four concur. For, in every work of God there is mercy and juſtice,<note place="margin">Aq. qu. <hi>21.</hi> ar. <hi>4.</hi>

                     </note> ſo hath Gods mercy afforded us.

His Mercy is infinite in Extent: for it is in all places; yea, where there is no place: And it is infinite in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; For as it never begun, (for the Ideating of this world,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169845:75"/>which was from everlaſting, was a work of mercy) and as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions which by acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it ſeemes to ſuffer here, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue it not, (for though God ſay, <hi>For a moment in mine anger I hid my face from thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 54.8.</note> yet he adds there, <hi>yet with everlaſting Mercy have I had compaſſion on thee;</hi>) ſo alſo is it reaſonable to think, that it ſhall never have end. And becauſe in heaven there can be no diſtinct and particular act of Mercy from God, becauſe there ſhall be no demerit in us, nor poſſibility of it, after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Therefore, and from the <hi>Pſalm, Non continebit in ira ſua miſericordias ſuas,</hi> ſome (but too licenciouſly) have concluded a determination and ending of the pains of the damned; and others learned and pious, and accuſed by no body for this opinion, evict from hence, certain <hi>intervalla,</hi> and relaxations in the torments of Hell,<note place="margin">Lomb. <hi>l. 4.</hi> Diſt. <hi>46.</hi> ex Auguſt.</note> after the generall Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as all confeſſe a diminiſhing of the pains there, and that the

                     <hi>Jucundus homo, qui miſeretur, &amp; commodat;</hi> for that is the ſecond and higheſt ſtep in Compaſſion, Alacrity, and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to help. And as God, delighting moſt in mercy, hath propoſed to himſelfe moſt wayes for the exerciſe thereof, ſo hath he provided man of moſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that vertue. Every man contributes to it, by being Agent, or Patient. Certainly, we were all miſerable, if none were; for we wanted the excerciſe of the profitableſt vertue. For though a Judg may be juſt, though none tranſgreſſe; and we might be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, though none wanted, by keeping ever a diſpoſion to be ſuch,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169845:76"/>if need were; yet what can we hope would ſerve to awake us then, which ſnort now under the cries of the wretched, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our own conſciences, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall promiſes of reward from God, and his loud threatnings for ſuch omiſſions? Amongſt the Rules of State, it is taught and practis'd for one, That they which advance and do good, muſt do it immediately from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that all the Obligation may be towards them: But when they will deſtroy or do hurt, they muſt do it inſtrumentally by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to remove and alienate the envy. Accordingly, when Princes communicate to any <hi>Jura Regalia,</hi> by that they are authorized to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, accuſe, purſue, condemne, execute, and diſpoil, but not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. God doth otherwiſe; for, for our firſt ſin, himſelfe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted death, and labour upon us. And, as it were to take from us all occaſion of evill, he doth all the evill of which his nature is capable, which is but <hi>Malum

But in our reformed Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the thriftieſt and cheapeſt that ever was inſtituted,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169845:78"/>(for our Sacrifices grow within us, and are our owne creatures, prayer and praiſe; and ſince our Beſſed Saviour hath given himſelf for us, we are now as men which had paid a great fine, and were bound to no other rent, then acknowledgements and ſervices) now that we have removed the expenſive digniſing of images, and relicks, what other exerciſe is there left for our charity, then thoſe nearer images both of God, and of our ſelves, the poore? <hi>Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull then, as your Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is mercifull.</hi> And how is he? <hi>homines &amp; jument a ſalvabis, Deus,</hi> Pſal. 35. and by <hi>jumenta</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood men not yet reduced to the knowledg of God.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169845:78"/>want. Alas, our greatneſs is Hydroptick, not ſolid: we are not firm, but puffed, and ſwoln; we are the lighter, and the leſſer for ſuch greatneſs. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> bragg'd how he could walk in his own ground; all this was his,<note place="margin">Aelian. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>28.</hi>

Let no ſmalneſſe retard thee: if thou beeſt not a Cedar to help towards a palace, if thou beeſt not Amber, Bezoar, nor liquid gold, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Princes; yet thou art a ſhrub to ſhelter a lambe, or to feed a bird; or thou art a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, to eaſe a childs ſmart; or a graſſe to cure a ſick dog. Love an asker better then a giver: which was good <hi>Agapetus</hi> counſel to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian:</hi> Yea rather, prevent the asking; and do not ſo much joyn and concur with miſery, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to grow to that ſtrength, that it ſhall make thy brother ask, and put him to the danger of a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169845:79"/>denyall. Avoid in giving, that which the Canoniſts expreſſe by <hi>Cyminibilis,</hi> which is a trifling giver. And give not (as <hi>Seneca</hi> cals them) <hi>panes lapidoſos;</hi> which are benefits hardly drawn, which have onely the ſhape, not the nouriſhment of benefits: But give as thou wouldſt receive. For thou giveſt not, but reſtoreſt, yea thou performeſt another du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too, thou lendeſt. Thou doſt not waſte, but lay up; and thou gaineſt in loſing.

And therefore, as waggoners in ſteep deſcents, tie the teame behind, not to draw it up, but to ſtop ſodaine precipitations downward, ſo, onely to prevent ſuch ſlipery downfals, I ſay, That as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt forbids, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Be not juſt orvermuch,</hi> ſo one may

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169845:83"/>reparation, and leave it as well as we found it, (for, <hi>ut gignamus geniti</hi>) yet ſince we have here two employments, one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this world, another to increaſe Gods Kingdome, none is to be accuſed, that every one doth not all, ſo all do all. For as, though every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man by his diet and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſhould preſerve his own body, and ſo obſerve it by his own experience of it, that he might ordinarily be his own Phyſician; yet it is fit, that ſome ſepoſe all their time for that ſtudy, and be able to inſtruct and reform others; So, though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould watch his own ſteps, and ſerve God in his vocation; yet there ſhould be ſome, whoſe Vocation it ſhould be to ſerve God; as all ſhould do it, ſo ſome ſhould do nothing elſe.

Therefore to advance propagation, lawes have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and curious. Some have forbidden a man to divide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to divers women, becauſe, though God in his ſecret ends have ſomtimes permitted it to the Patriarchs, and though (being able to make contraries ſerve to one end) he threatens in another place, that <hi>ten women ſhall follow one man;</hi> yet ordinarily this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of a mans ſelf, fruſtrates propagation, and is in it ſelfe a confeſſion, that he ſeeks not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.<note place="margin">Maximini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano, &amp; Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> And therefore the <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi> juſtly extols that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who married young; <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum jam, tum miraculum, juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis uxorius.</hi> And ſome lawes in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169845:84"/>the <hi>Greek</hi> States enforced men to marry: and the <hi>Roman</hi> law pretended to have the ſame ends, but with more ſweetneſſe, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving priviledges to the married: but ever increaſing them with their number of children, of which to have had none, threw a man back again into penalty; for of the eſtate of ſuch, a tenth part was confiſcate; for to have children, is ſo much of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the lawfulneſſe of that act, that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>Si prolem ex conditione vitant,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Exod. 12.41.</note> for the time of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was but 215. years. And the number of men, which is 600000. is only of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men,<note place="margin">Numb. 1.</note> which cannot well be thought a fiſt part of all the ſouls. The whole number <hi>Joſephus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning 10. to a paſchal lamb, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> do, brings to be 3700000. yet to me theſe ſeem no great parts of Gods exceeding Mercy in this Hiſtory; for from ſo many, in ſuch a ſpace, God, without miracle, by affording twins, and preſerving alive, might ordinarily have derived more men then ever were at once upon the whole earth. But whether his decree have appointed a certain number which mankind ſhall not exceed, (as it ſeems to be a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conjecture of the whole, becauſe in the moſt famous parts it is found to have held; <hi>Rome,</hi> and

                     <hi>Venice,</hi> and like States never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that number to which they have very ſoon arrived:) Or that the whole earth is able to nouriſh no more, without doubt it is evident, that the world had very long ſince as many ſouls as ever it had, or may be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have ever hereafter. And it is a very probable conjecture, that the reaſon, why, ſince wolves produce oftner, and more then ſheep, and more ſheep are killed then wolves, yet more ſheep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, is, becauſe they are che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by all induſtry. For only there men increaſe, where there is means for their ſuſtentation. That therefore which God did mercifully in this, was, that he propagated them to ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers under ſuch oppreſſions and deſtructions: for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> cruelly cauſed them to ſerve,<note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> and made them weary of their lives by ſore labour, with all manner of bondage: yea, their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſcornfully miſ-interpreted, <hi>Becauſe you are idle, you ſay, let

If then they could chide him into mercy, and make him mercifull not only to their ſin, but for their ſin, where or when may we doubt of his mercy? Of which, we will here end the conſideration; not without an humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is not his leaſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that we have been thus long poſſeſſed with the meditation thereof: for thus long we have been in the Harbour, but we launch into a main and unknown Sea, when we come to conſider his <hi>Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of all the wayes in which God hath expreſſed himſelfe towards us, we have made no word which doth leſſe ſignifie what we mean, then <hi>Power:</hi> for <hi>Power,</hi> which is but an ability to do, ever relates to ſome future thing: and God is ever a preſent, ſimple, and pure Act. But we think we have done
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169845:93"/>much, and gone far, when we have made up the word <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> which is both wayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for it is much too ſhort, becauſe <hi>Omnipotence</hi> ſuppoſes and confeſſes a matter and ſubject to work upon, and yet God was the ſame, when there was nothing. And then it over-reaches, and goes down-wards beyond God: for God hath not, or is not ſuch an Omnipotence, as can do all things; for though ſqueamiſh and tenderer men think it more mannerly to ſay, <hi>This thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done,</hi> then, <hi>God cannot do this thing;</hi> yet it is all one: And if that be an Omnipotence, which is limited with the nature of the worker, or with the congruity of the ſubject, other things may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the word <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</hi> that is, they can do all things which are not againſt their nature, or the nature of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon which they work. <hi>Beza</hi> therefore might well enough ſay, That God could not make a body without place; And <hi>Prateolus</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:169845:94"/>might truly enough infer upon that,<note place="margin">Verbo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanitae.</note> that the <hi>Bezanites</hi> (as he calls them) deny omnipotence in God; for both are true. And therefore I doubt not, but it hath ſome myſterie, that the word <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi> is not found in all the Bible; nor <hi>Omnipotent</hi> in the New Teſtament. And where it is in the Old, it would rather be interpreted <hi>All-ſufficient,</hi> then <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;</hi> between which there is much difference. God is ſo <hi>Al-ſufficient,</hi> that he is ſufficient for all, and ſufficient to all: He is enough, and we are in him able enough to take and apply. We fetch part of our wealth, which is our faith, expreſly from his Treaſury: And for our good works, we bring the metall to his Mint, (or that Mint comes to us) and there the Character of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the impreſſion of his grace, makes them currant, and ſomewhat worth, even towards him. God is <hi>all-efficient:</hi> that is, hath created the beginning, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the way, fore-ſeen the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169845:94"/>end of every thing; and nothing elſe is any kind of cauſe thereof. Yet, ſince this word <hi>efficient,</hi> is now grown to ſignifie infallibility in God, it reaches not home to that which we mean of God; ſince man is efficient cauſe of his own deſtruction. God is alſo <hi>all-conficient:</hi> that is, concurs with the nature of every thing; for indeed the nature of every thing is that which he works in it. And as he redeemed not man as he was God, (though the Mercy, and Purpoſe, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation were only of God) but as God and man; ſo in our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances and reconciliations, though the firſt grace proceed only from God, yet we concurr ſo, as there is an union of two Hypoſtaſes, <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> Which, (as the incarnation of our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf was) is conceived in us of the Holy Ghoſt, without father; but fed and produced by us; that is, by our will firſt enabled and illumined. For neither God nor man determine mans will; for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169845:95"/>that muſt either imply a neceſſiting therof from God, or elſe <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi>) but they condetermine it. And thus God is truly <hi>all-confici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> that is, concurrent in all; and yet we may not dare to ſay, that he hath any part in ſin. So God is alſo <hi>all-perficient:</hi> that is, all, and all parts of every work are his intirely: and leſt any might ſeem to eſcape him, and be attributed to Nature or to Art, all things were in him at once, before he made Nature, or ſhe Art. All things which we do to day were done by us in him, before we were made. And now, (when they are produced in time, as they were foreſeen in eternity,) his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing grace provokes every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good work, and his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting grace perfects it. And yet we may not ſay, but that God begins many things which we fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; and calls when we come not. So that, as yet our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath found no word, which is well proportioned to that which we mean by <hi>power of God;</hi> much leſs of that refined and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169845:95"/>part thereof, which we chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider in this place, which is the abſolute and tranſcendent <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Miracles,</hi> with which this Hiſtory abounds. For whatſoever God did for his Iſraelits, beſide Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, was but an extenſion of his Mercy, and belongs to that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph which we have ended before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> is the <hi>Common law</hi> by which God governs us, and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> is his <hi>Prerogative.</hi> For Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are but ſo many <hi>Non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes</hi> upon Nature. And Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is not like prerogative in any thing more then in this, that no body can tell what it is. For firſt, Creation and ſuch as that, are not Miracles, becauſe they are not (to ſpeak in that language) <hi>Nata fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri per alium modum.</hi> And ſo, only that is Miracle, which might be done naturally, and is not ſo done. And then, leſt we allow the Divell a power to do Miracles, we muſt ſay, that Miracle is <hi>contra totam Naturam,</hi> againſt the whole order and diſpoſition of Nature. For as in Cities, a father governs
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169845:96"/>his family by a certain Order, which yet the Magiſtrate of the City may change for the Cities good, and a higher Officer may change the Cities Order; but none, all, except the King: ſo, I can change ſome naturall things (as I can make a ſtone fly upward) a Phyſician more, and the Divell more then he; but only God can change all. And after that is out of neceſſity eſtabliſhed, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> is againſt the whole <hi>Order</hi> of Nature, I ſee not how there is left in God a power of Miracles. For, the Miracles which are produced to day, were determined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the body of the whole Hiſtory of Nature (though they ſeem to us to be but interlineary and Marginall) at the beginning, and are as infallible and certain, as the moſt Ordinary and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary things. Which is evicted and approved by that which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> ſays, and particularly proves,<note place="margin">De vera Sap. c. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> that all Chriſts Miracles were long before prophecied. So that truly nothing can be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169845:96"/>the Order of Nature. For, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays truly,<note place="margin">Cont. Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum l. <hi>26.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> That is Naturall to each thing, which God doth, from whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all Faſhion, Number and Order of Nature: for that God, whoſe Decree is the Nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, ſhould do againſt his own Decree, if he ſhould do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nature. As therefore if we underſtood all created Nature, nothing would be <hi>Mirum</hi> to us; ſo if we knew Gods purpoſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be <hi>Miraculum.</hi> For certainly, thoſe Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, after God had once revealed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would do them, were not Miracles to him, no more then the works of the Conjurers, which <hi>ex Ratione Rei,</hi> were as true as his. But the expreſſing of his power at this time was, that in the ſight of ſuch underſtanders and workmaſters, as the <hi>Magi</hi> were, he would do more without any Inſtrument conducing to thoſe ends, then they could do by their beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, the Divell; and ſo
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169845:97"/>draw from them that confeſſion, <hi>Digitus Dei hìc eſt:</hi> for elſe who could have diſtinguiſhed between his and their works, or denied the name of <hi>Miracle</hi> to theirs? for they (not to depart at this time from vulgar Philoſophy; not that I bind your faith to it, but that if we abandon this, it is not eaſie and ready to conſtitute another ſo defenſible) by their power of locall Motion, and Application of Active and paſſive things, could oppoſe matter to heate, and ſo produce frogs truly; yea, when ſuch things are brought together by ſuch a workman, he can by them produce greater effects then nature could. As an Axe and timber being in the hand of a Statuary, he can make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; which they two, or a leſs skilfull Agent could not do. But God wrought not ſo: But, as <hi>Arnobius</hi> ſayes, he did them, <hi>Sine vi carminum,</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169845:98"/>(for it were too much to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures of a new Species,) certainly, the Divell can produce all ſuch. Either then the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being meerly new, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell underſtood not of what it was compoſed; Or God changed the form of Duſt into another form, which the Divell could never do; or elſe, God manacled his hand in the eaſieſt thing, to confound him the more; for after this, it appears not that the <hi>Magi</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do any more Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. To diſcountenance then their deceits, and withall to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was the principall purpoſe of God in theſe Miracles: not to declare himſelf, or beget faith; for he doth not alwayes bind miracles to faith, nor faith to miracles.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169845:99"/>ſeems to be the ſame, That then ignorant men were ſent to preach Chriſtianity amongſt men armed and inſtructed againſt it, with all kindes of learnings and philoſophies; but now learned men are ſent to the ignorant; and are ſuperiour to them in Reaſon and in Civility, and in Authority; and beſides, preſent them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion leſs incredible then their own.

God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, I ſhould deny or obſcure the power and practice of our bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles, in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Divels in the primitive Church: but that the Roman Church ſhould make an Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and bind Apprentices to it (for ſuch are thoſe little boys whom they make Exorciſts) and then make them free when they receive greater Orders, and yet forbid them to ſet up, or utter their ware but where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, is ſcarce agreeable to the firſt Examples, I dare not ſay, Inſtitution; for I ſee not that this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169845:100"/>Order had any. Why we do not ſo, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>non fuit ſic ab initio:</hi> And no hardneſſe of heart is enough to juſtifie a toleration of theſe <hi>devout deceits</hi> and <hi>holy lyes,</hi> as they are often called amongſt themſelves. The Power of God, which we cannot name, needs not our help. And this very Hiſtory (in expounding of which <hi>Pererius</hi> inculcates ſo often, <hi>Non multiplicanda mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi>) which ſeems the principalleſt record of Gods Miracles, though literally it ſeem to be directed to his enemies, by often expreſſing his power; yet to his children it inſinuates an Admonition, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Miracles, ſince it tels them how great things the Divel did: And that his giving over in no great thing, but the leaſt of all, ſhows, That that was not a cancelling of his Patent, which he had in his Creation, but onely a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> not to execute it at that time. For, (excepting the ſtaying of the Sun, and carrying it back (if it be cleer that the body
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169845:101"/>of the Sun was carried back, and not the ſhadow only) and a very few more) it appears enough, that the Divell hath done oftner grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miracles, then the children of God: For God delights not ſo much in the exerciſe of his <hi>Power,</hi> as of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which partakes of both the other: For <hi>Mercy</hi> is his <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and garden, in which he deſcends to walk and converſe with man: <hi>Power</hi> his <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Arſenel,</hi> by which he protects and overthrows: <hi>Juſtice</hi> his <hi>Exchequer,</hi> where he preſerves his own Dignity, and exacts our Forfeitures.</p>
                  <p>Even at firſt God intimated how unwillingly he is drawn to execute <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon tranſgreſſors; for he firſt exerciſed all the reſt: <hi>Mercy,</hi> in purpoſing our Creation; <hi>Power,</hi> in doing it; and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in giving us a Law: Of which the written part was in a volume and character ſo familiar and inward to us (for it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our hearts, and by Nature)
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169845:101"/>as needed no Expoſitor: And that part which was vocall, and delivered by Edict and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ſo ſhort, ſo perſpicuous, and ſo eaſie (for it was but prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitory, and exacted nothing from Man) as it is one of the greateſt ſtrangeneſſes in the Story, that they could ſo ſoon forget the Text thereof, and not eſpy the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents additions and falſifications. And then at laſt God interpoſed his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> yet not ſo much for <hi>Justice</hi> ſake, as to get opportunitie of <hi>new Mercy,</hi> in promiſing a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; of <hi>new Power,</hi> in raiſing again bodies made mortall by that ſin; and of <hi>new Judgments,</hi> in delivering, upon more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, a more particular law, apparelled with Ceremonies, the cement and mortar of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, and often the inflamer of interior Religion. So that almoſt all Gods Juſtice is but Mercy: as all our Mercy is but Juſtice; for we are all mutuall debtors to one another; but he to none. Yea, both his <hi>Nature,</hi> and his <hi>will</hi> are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169845:102"/>ſo condition'd, as he cannot do Juſtice ſo much as man can. For, for his <hi>will,</hi> though he neither will nor can do any thing <hi>againſt</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he doth many things <hi>beſide</hi> it. Nothing unjuſtly, but many things not juſtly: for he rewards beyond our Merits, and our ſins are beyond his puniſhments. And then, we have exerciſe as well of Commutative Juſtice as Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; God only of the later, ſince he can receive nothing from us. And indeed, Diſtributive Juſtice in God, is nothing but Mercy. So that there is but one limb of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice left to God, which is Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; And of that, all the degrees on this ſide finall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are acts of Mercy. So that the <hi>Vulture,</hi> by which ſome of the Ancients figured <hi>Juſtice,</hi> was a juſt ſymbole of this Juſtice;<note place="margin">Pierius li. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> for as that bird prayes onely upon Carcaſſes, and upon nothing which lives; ſo this Juſtice appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends none but ſuch as are dead and putrified in ſin and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:169845:102"/>To proceed then: All ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſignifications of <hi>Juſtice</hi> will conveniently be reduced to theſe two, <hi>Innocence,</hi> which in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures is every where called Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: or elſe <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for tranſgreſſions, which, though Chriſt have paid aforehand for us all, and ſo we are rather pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then put to ſatisfaction; yet we are bound at Gods tribunall to plead our pardon, and to pay the fees of contrition and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For, ſince our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now conſiſts not in a pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, (for then nothing but that which is infinite could have any proportion) but in the application of the merits of Chriſt to us, our contrition (which is a compaſſion with Chriſt, and ſo an incorporating of our ſelves into his merit) hath <hi>aliqualem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionem</hi> to Gods Juſtice; and the paſſion of Chriſt had not <hi>aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but that Gods acceptation (which alſo dignifies our contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though not to that height) advanced it to that worthineſſe.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169845:103"/>To enquire further the way and manner by which God makes a few do acceptable works; or, how out of a corrupt lumpe he ſelects and purifies a few, is but a ſtumbling block and a tentation: Who asks a charitable man that gives him an almes, where he got it, or why he gave it? will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favorite, whom his Prince on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his appliableneſs to him, or ſome half-vertue, or his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, burdens with Honours and Fortunes every day, and deſtines to future Offices and Dignities, diſpute or expoſtulate with his Prince, why he rather choſe not another, how he will reſtore his Coffers; how he will quench his peoples murmurings, by whom this liberality is fed; or his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with whom he equalls new men; and will not rather repoſe himſelf gratefully in the wiſdome, greatneſs &amp; bounty of his Maſter? Will a languiſhing deſperate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that hath ſcarce time enough to ſwallow the potion, examine the Phyſician, how he procured
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169845:103"/>thoſe ingredients, how that ſoyle nouriſhed them, which humor they affect in the body, whether they work by exceſs of quality, or ſpecifically; whether he have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them by correcting, or elſe by withdrawing their Malignity; and for ſuch unneceſſary ſcruples neglect his health? Alas, our time is little enough for prayer, and praiſe, and ſociety; which is, for our mutuall duties. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Divinity becomes us all; but Naturall Divinity, and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Divinity, almoſt all may ſpare. Almoſt all the ruptures in the Chriſtian Church have been occaſioned by ſuch bold diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>De Modo.</hi> One example is too much. That our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours body is in the Sacrament, all ſay; The <hi>Roman</hi> Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points it to be there by <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> The needleſs multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Miracles for that opinion hath moved the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lvetick</hi> reformed Churches to find the word Sacramentally; which, becauſe it puts the body
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169845:104"/>there, and yet no nearer then Heaven to Earth, ſeems a riddle to the <hi>Saxon</hi> and ſuch Churches; whoſe modeſty (though not clearneſs) ſeems greateſt in this Point; ſince beleeving the reall being of it there, they abſtain generally (though ſome bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers amongſt them alſo do exorbitate) from pronouncing <hi>De Modo.</hi> The like tempeſts hath the inquiſition <hi>De Modo,</hi> rais'd in the article of Deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, even in our Church; and of the conveyance of Gods grace (which was the occaſion of this digreſſion) in the <hi>Roman</hi> at this day. But to decline this ſad contemplation, and to further our ſelves in the Meditation of Gods juſtice declared, in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, let me obſerve to you, that God in his Scriptures hath Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred eſpecially three ſymbols or Sacraments, of uſe in this matter. One in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> of pure and meer <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cha. 3.22.</note> vindicative, and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; which is, The <hi>Cherubim and fiery ſword</hi> placed in Paradiſe,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169845:104"/>to <hi>keep out,</hi> not only <hi>Adam,</hi> but his <hi>Poſterity.</hi> The ſecond in <hi>Exodus,</hi> of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>only Mercy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 25.17</note> which is the modell and fabrick of the <hi>Mercy ſeate,</hi> under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of two Cherubims wings. The third, partaking of both <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and a Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſeal of both, is the <hi>Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> after the Deluge.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.14.</note> The firſt of theſe, which is of <hi>meer Juſtice,</hi> is ſo figurative, and ſo myſtick, and ſo unfit for Example or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and ſo diſputable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it laſted long, or ever were literally, that it ſeems God had no purpoſe to deliver any evident teſtimony of ſo ſevere and <hi>meer Juſtice.</hi> But that of <hi>meer Mercy,</hi> he made ſo familiar, that only deviſing the form himſelf, he committed the making of it to man: and ſo affiancing and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Mercy to mans work, did, as it were, put his Mercy into our hands. Yet that alſo is long ſince tranſlated from us: and there remains only the middle one, more convenient, and proportionall,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169845:105"/>and uſefull. For, as it betokens his Juſtice in the precedent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, or his Merey in aſſuring us from any future; ſo is it made of naturall and well known cauſes, (and thereby familiar to us) and yet became a Sacrament by Gods ſpeciall inſtitution then.<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>28.</hi> in Gen.</note> And, though it ſhould be true which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays, That it was a new miracle then, and never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before;<note place="margin">De Noe &amp; Area, cap. <hi>27</hi>
                     </note> yea, though that could be true which <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſomewhat againſt the text, and directly againſt the other Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſays, That the <hi>Bow</hi> mentioned there was not a <hi>Rainbow,</hi> but that <hi>A bow in the clouds,</hi> ſignifies only, <hi>The power of God in perſecution,</hi> and thereupon he obſerves, that God ſays, <hi>A Bow,</hi> but ſays not <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> to inflict terror, not wounds; Every way, I ſay, it doth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of remembring Gods Juſtice and Mercy together. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, in this large and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Hiſtory of Gods Juſtice and Perſecution, both towards his children, and his enemies, if we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169845:105"/>conſider their laborious waſte and maceratings of their bodies by hot and intemperate labour; All their contempts, and ſcorns, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, and annihilating in the eye of the Egyptians; All their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and enfeebling their race by the Edict of deſtroying their male children; All their deviations and ſtrayings forty years, in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of a few dayes; and all their penuries and battels in that jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; And then for the Egyptians, if we looke upon all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, firſt of plagues hatefull to their ſenſes, then noiſome to their fruites, then to their cattel, then to their bodies, then to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, then to their lives, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only the drowning of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians in the ſea, and the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iſraelites by their own hands in their guiltineſſe of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with the Calfe, it will ſcarce be found that any of the afflictions proceeded from meer Juſtice, but were rather as Phyſick, and had only a medicinall bitterneſſe in them. It remains, for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169845:106"/>of this Meditation, that we ſpeake a little of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>And at this time, (as by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite places in the Scriptures we are directed) we call Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all thoſe lawes and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which he hath informed the Judgements of his children, and by which he governes his Judgements with or againſt them. For otherwiſe this word <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hath alſo three profane, and three Divine acceptations. Of the firſt ſort, the firſt ſerves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations only, and ſo, <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the laſt act of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and a concluſive reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: which both in private ſtudies, and at Counſail tables, many want, though endued with excellent abilities of obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, diſputing, infirming, yea deſtroying others allegations; yet are not able to eſtabliſh or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any other from themſelves. Theſe men, whether you conſult them in Religion, or State, or Law,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169845:106"/>onely when they are joyned with others, have good uſe, becauſe they bring doubts into diſceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; elſe, they are, at leaſt unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: and are but as Simpliciſts, which know the venom and pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant quality of every herbe, but cannot fit them to Medicin; or ſuch a Lapidary, which can ſoone ſpie the flaw, but not mend it with ſetting. Judgement in the <hi>Second</hi> acceptation ſerves for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and is almoſt ſynonimous with Diſcretion; when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not ſo much the thing which we then do, as the whole frame and machine of the buſineſſe, as it is complexioned and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced with time, and place, and behoders: and ſo, make a thing, which was at moſt but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, good. The <hi>third</hi> way, Judgement ſerves not only preſent practice, but enlightens, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt governs poſterity; and theſe are Decrees and Sentences, and Judgments in Courts. The phraſe of Divinity alſo accepts Judgment three wayes; for ſomtimes it is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169845:107"/>ſevere and meer Juſtice, as, <hi>[Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt begin at the houſe of God,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.7.</note> And many ſuch. And Judgment in this ſenſe, is deep and unſearchable. For, though <hi>Solomon</hi> pronounce,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.17.</note> 
                     <hi>[There is a juſt man that periſheth in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and there is a wicked man that continueth long in his malice;]</hi> yet he enquires for no reaſon of it:<note place="margin">Pſa. 36.6.</note> For, <hi>[Gods righteouſneſs is like the mountains]</hi> eminent and inviting our contemplation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven; but, <hi>[his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are like a great deep,]</hi> terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bottomleſs, and declining us towards the center of horrour and deſperation. <hi>Theſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> we cannot meaſure nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome; yet, for all that, we muſt more then beleeve them to be juſt; for the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We know the Judgement of God is according to truth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2.2.</note> But yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes Judgement ſignifies not <hi>meer Juſtice,</hi> but as it is attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred and ſweetned with Mercy. For, by the phraſe of the Pſalmiſt, [<hi>Judicabit populum in Juſtitia,</hi>

                  <p>The greatneſs of this benefit or bleſſing of giving them a law, was not that ſalvation was due to the fulfilling of it; nor were they bound to a perfect fulfilling of it upon damnation; for, Salvation was ever from a faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apoſtle reaſons ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, <hi>[The promiſe of Chriſt to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was</hi> 430 <hi>years before the law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.17.</note> and therefore this cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annull that]</hi> and yet this to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was but an iteration of the promiſe formerly given, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169845:109"/>iterated often. But one benefit of the Law was, that it did in ſome meaſure reſtore them towards the firſt light of Nature: For, if man had kept that, he had neeeded no outward law; for then he was to himſelf a law, having all law in his heart; as God promiſeth for one of the greateſt bleſſings under the Goſpel, when the Law of Nature is more cleerly reſtored:<note place="margin">Jer. 13.31.</note>

As we may obſerve in the Jews, who, after the Law of Nature was clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and darkened in man by ſin, framed to themſelves many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective laws, before the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this Law in the Deſart.<note place="margin">Bretram.

But theſe had but half the nature of Law; they did direct, but not correct; they did but counſell, not command: and they were not particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do that office fully; for they ſhew'd not all.<note place="margin">Ro. 3.20.</note> Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the ſufficiency of it,<note place="margin">Ro. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>By the Law comes the knowledge of ſin.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> And again, <hi>When the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, ſin revived;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> it revived to his underſtanding and conſcience: For, that ſin was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any written commandement, himſelf cleers it; <hi>

                     <hi>but ſin is not imputed when there is no law.</hi> Not that God imputes it not; (for there is always enough within us for him to try us by; and his written Laws are but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory of the former;) but we
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169845:110"/>impute it not to our ſelves, by confeſſion and repentance. This therefore is the benefit of the Law, that (as <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place ſayes) <hi>Arguit, objurgat, &amp; velli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando nos expergefacit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lev. 24.10</note> We read in <hi>Leviticus, That a Blaſphemer was ſtoned,</hi> and after his execution a law was made againſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: If it had been made before, perchance he had not periſhed. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes lawes, though they be ambiguous, yea impoſſible, avert men from doing many things, which may, in their fear, be drawn within the compaſs of that Law. Not to go far for Examples; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, our Law which makes <hi>Multiplication</hi> Felony, keeps ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from doing things which may be ſo called, for any thing they know, though perchance no body know what <hi>Multiplication</hi> is.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169845:110"/>to feed a ſpirit. Another benefit of the law, (taking the law at large, for all the Scriptures, as the Apoſtle doth, [<hi>Tell me,</hi>

                     <hi>[I am Captive to the law of ſin.]</hi> And, <hi>[I ſerve in my fleſh the law of ſin.]</hi> Theſe then were the advantages of the law; And had it any diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169845:111"/>It is true, the laws were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for, as the frame of our body hath 248 bones,<note place="margin">Fra. Geor. To. <hi>2.</hi> prob. <hi>8.</hi>

                  <hi>O</hi> Eternall God, as thou didſt admit thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to make the granting of one petition an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and riſe to another, and gaveſt him leave to gather upon thee from fifty to ten; ſo I beſeech thee, that ſince by thy grace, I have thus long meditated upon thee, and ſpoken of thee, I may now ſpeak to thee. As thou haſt enlightned and enlarged me to contemplate thy greatneſs, ſo, O God, deſcend thou and ſtoop down to ſee my infirmities and the Egypt in which I live; and (If thy good pleaſure be ſuch) haſten mine <hi>Exodus</hi> and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for I deſire to be, diſolved, and be with thee. O Lord, I moſt humbly acknowledg and confeſs
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169845:113"/>thine infinite Mercy, that when thou hadſt almoſt broke the ſtaff of bread, and called a famine of thy word almoſt upon all the world, then thou broughteſt me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Egypt, where thou hadſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thy ſtewards to husband thy bleſſings, and to feed thy ſtock. Here alſo, O God, thou haſt multiplied thy children in me, by begetting and cheriſhing in me reverent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and pious affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, but that mine own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, mine own <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hath ever ſmothered and ſtrangled them. And thou haſt put me in my way towards thy land of promiſe, thy Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> by removing me from the Egypt of frequented and populous, glorious places, to a more ſolitary and deſart retiredneſs, where I may more ſafely feed upon both thy Mannaes, thy ſelf in thy Sacrament, and that other, which is true Angells food, contemplation of thee. O Lord, I moſt humbly acknowledg and confeſs, that I feel in me ſo many ſtrong effects of thy Power, as only for the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169845:114"/>and frequency thereof, they are not Miracles. For hourly thou rectifieſt my lameneſs, hourly thou reſtoreſt my ſight, and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not only delivereſt me from the Egypt, but raiſeſt me from the death of ſin. My ſin, O God, hath not onely cauſed thy deſcent hither, and paſſion here; but by it I am become that hell into which thou deſcendedſt after thy Paſſion; yea, after thy glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for hourly thou in thy Spirit deſcendeſt into my heart, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw there Legions of ſpirits of Diſobedience, and Incredulity, and Murmuring. O Lord, I most humbly acknowledg and confeſſe, that by thy Mercy I have a ſenſe of thy Justice; for not onely thoſe afflictions with which it pleaſeth thee to exerciſe mee, awaken me to conſider how terrible thy ſevere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is; but even the rest and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which thou affordeſt mee, puts me often into fear, that thou reſerveſt and ſpareſt me for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of puniſhment. O Lord, I most humbly acknowledg
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169845:114"/>and confeſſe, that I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſin, by underſtanding thy laws and judgments; but have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy known and revealed will. Thou haſt ſet up many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks, and kindled many lamps in mee; but I have either blown them out, or carried them to guide me in by and forbidden ways. Thou haſt given mee a deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and ſome meanes to it, and ſome poſſeſſion of it; and I have arm'd my ſelf with thy weapons againſt thee: Yet, O God, have mercy upon me, for thine own ſake have mercy upon me. Let not ſin and me be able to exceed thee, nor to defraud thee, nor to fruſtrate thy purpoſes: But let me, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of Me, be of ſo much uſe to thy glory, that by thy mercy to my ſin, other ſinners may ſee how much ſin thou canst pardon. Thus ſhow mercy to many in one: And ſhew thy power and al-mightineſſe upon thy ſelf, by casting manacles upon thine own hands, and calling back thoſe Thunder-bolts which thou hadſt thrown againſt me. Show
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169845:115"/>thy Juſtice upon the common Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer and Devourer of us all: and ſhow to us ſo much of thy Judgments, as may inſtruct, not condemn us.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169845:115"/>them their petitions. We confeſs, O God, that we are not worthy ſo much as to confeſs; leſs to be heard, leaſt of all to be pardoned our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold ſins and tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee. We have betrayed thy Temples to prophaneſs, our bodies to ſenſuality, thy fortreſſes to thine enemy, our ſoules to Satan. We have armed him with thy munition to fight againſt thee, by ſurrendring our eyes, and eares, all our ſenſes, all our faculties to be exerciſed and wrought upon, and tyrannized by him. Vanities and diſguiſes have covered us, and thereby we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; licenciouſneſs hath inflam'd us, and thereby we are frozen; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs hath fed us, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are ſterved, the fancies and traditions of men have taught and instructed us, and thereby we are ignorant. Theſe diſtempers, thou only, O God, who art true, and perfect harmonie, canſt tune, and rectify, and ſet in order again.

We renounce, O Lord, all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in this world; for this
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169845:116"/>world paſſeth away, and the luſts thereof: Wee renounce all our confidence in our own merits for we have done nothing in reſpect of that which we might have done; neither could we ever have done any ſuch thing, but that ſtill we must have remained unprofitable ſervants to thee; we renounce all confidence, even in our own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and accuſations of our ſelf; for our ſins are above number, if we would reckon them; above weight and meaſure, if we would weigh and meaſure them; and paſt finding out, if we would ſeek them in thoſe dark corners, in which we have multiplied them againſt thee: yea we renounce all confidence even in our repentances; for we have found by many lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that we never perform our promiſes to thee, never perfect our purpoſes in our ſelves, but relapſe again and again into thoſe ſins which again and again we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169845:117"/>for us, by ſitting down at thy right hand. We have no confidence in our merits, but in him, whoſe merits thou haſt been pleaſed to accept for us, and to apply to us, we have: no confidence in our own confeſsions and repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in that bleſſed Spirit, who is the Author of them, and loves to perfect his own works and build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own foundations, we have: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them therefore, O Lord, for their ſakes whoſe they are; our poor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, for thy glorious Sons ſake, who gives them their root, and ſo they are his; our poor beginnings of ſanctification, for thy bleſſed Spirits ſake, who gives them their growth, and ſo they are his: and for thy Sons ſake, in whom only our prayers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to thee: and for thy Spirits ſake which is now in us, &amp; muſt be ſo whenſoever we do pray acceptably to thee; accept our humble prayers for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169845:117"/>were a more ſinfull contempt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, then all thoſe, to doubt of thy mercy for them; have mercy upon us: In the merits and mediation of thy Son, our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, be mercifull unto us. Suffer not, O Lord, ſo great a waſte, as the effuſion of his blood, without any return to thee; ſuffer not the expence of ſo rich a treaſure, as the ſpending of his life, without any purchace to thee; but as thou didſt empty and evacuate his glory here upon earth, glorify us with that glory which his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchaſed for us in the kingdom of Heaven. And as thou didſt empty that Kingdome of thine, in a great part, by the baniſhment of thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, whoſe pride threw them into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting ruine, be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that Kingdom, which their fall did ſo far depopulate, by aſſuming us into their places, and making us rich with their confiſcations.
